# Bus Synchronization Program README

## Introduction
This Java program simulates a bus stop where riders wait for a bus and buses arrive to pick up riders. The program enforces synchronization constraints to ensure proper boarding and departure of buses.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java source code using the following command:

   ```shell
   javac src/*.java
   ```

4. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   java -cp src Main
   ```

## Program Description
- Riders arrive at the bus stop and wait for a bus.
- Buses arrive at the bus stop.
- Riders board the bus, and the bus departs when full or when no riders are waiting.
- Proper synchronization mechanisms are used to ensure safety and adherence to constraints.

## Output
The program will display output indicating rider and bus arrivals, boarding actions, and departures. A screenshot of the program's output is included in the 'screenshots' directory.

## Customization
You can customize various parameters and constants within the source code, such as bus capacity and inter-arrival times for riders and buses.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
